										<strong>
											Bruce M. was a handsome, wealthy, self-made multi-millionaire businessman who most
											people would think had it all.
										</strong>
									</p>
									<p>
										He trained as an attorney in Australia, graduating near the top of his class. Before he
										was
										thirty, he made his first million, and built success upon success.
									</p>
									<p>
										Young, wealthy, a hit with the ladies, anybody would think that Bruce had it made. Yes, he
										had
										it all…except for one terrible problem.
									</p>
									<p>
										<strong>
											Bruce suffered from a literal “Achilles Heel” that sometimes made his life a living
											hell.
										</strong>
										He was plagued with terrible, stabbing foot and back pain that sometimes forced him to
										take
										to
										his bed like an invalid for weeks on end.
									</p>
									<hr>
									<p>
										<strong>
											Bruce went to the finest medical specialists in the world. He took appointments with
											top
											Western medical minds in New York, London, Melbourne, in fact, anywhere he thought he
											could
											find help for his pain.
										</strong>
									</p>
									<p>
										<strong>
											They did tests, C-Scans, biopsies, but not one of them could pinpoint why Bruce was
											suffering
											from this constant and crippling pain.
										</strong>
									</p>
									<hr>
									<div class="content__bg-yellow">
										<p>
											“The human body is complex, and there are just some things we cannot figure out.” one
											doctor
											in New York City told him. “There’s nothing seriously wrong with you, but we cannot
											figure
											out the source of your pain. It might be neuropathy or some abnormality of the nervous
											system.”
										</p>
										<p>
											Bruce was dismayed. “Just learn to live with it,” the doctor said, “You’re otherwise
											healthy.
											I’m sorry, there’s nothing I can do.”/p>
										<p>
											The doctor offered to give Bruce powerful narcotic pain killers but this is something
											Bruce
											didn’t want to do. He needed his mind to be sharp. He could not afford to be in a
											drug-induced daze.
										</p>
										<p>
											Fast forward a few years. Bruce finds himself in Japan on a business trip, and happens
											to
											discuss his chronic foot and back pain with a colleague.
										</p>
										<p>
											“You must go to this famous Ryokan (a spiritual retreat) where many famous Japanese go
											to
											find cures for their pain.” his Japanese friend <br> told him.
										</p>
									</div>
									<p>
										<strong>
											Bruce went to the Ryokan for a week. A practitioner who worked there took one look at
											Bruce’s
											stylish London-made shoes and frowned. “The feet are full of the most sensitive nerve
											endings
											and body energy centers. All body systems flow through the feet. Your shoes are
											probably
											hurting your body!”
										</strong>
									</p>
									<p>
										He handed Bruce a special, handmade pair of sandals which had been created according to
										centuries old methods. The sandals fit comfortably. Bruce felt a comfort which spread a
										warmth
										throughout his body.
									</p>
									<p>
										<strong>
											But most importantly, the soles of the sandals were covered with many soothing
											“acupoints”,
											which massaged and interacted with the natural nerve endings in the feet.
										</strong>
									</p>
								</div>

									<source srcset="img/first/content/02.webp" type="image/webp"><img class="content__img"
										src="img/first/content/02.jpg" alt="img">
								</picture>
								<p>
									<strong>
										In a couple of days, Bruce almost cried. His foot and back pain had subsided so much that
										he
										almost forgot there had been anything wrong.
									</strong>
								</p>
								<p>
									He tried to take home the sandals, but he was told they were a “secret of the Ryokan”. But
									Bruce
									now knew how to fix his foot and back pain, and he vowed to recreate the sandals, and even
									improve on them!
								</p>

								<div class="content__title">
									<h2>Famous Hong Kong Traditional <br> Doctor Yan Sang Wong Steps in!</h2>
								</div>
								<p>
									Bruce spoke to some people at the highest level in Hong Kong and was introduced to one of the
									most learned traditional specialists in the world.
								</p>
								<picture>
									<source srcset="img/first/content/03.webp" type="image/webp"><img class="content__img"
										src="img/first/content/03.jpg" alt="img">
								</picture>
								<p>
									The doctor was Dr. Yan Sang Wong. Bruce told him the story of the sandals at the Ryokan.
								</p>
								<p>
									The doctor agreed that acupoints could relieve foot and back pain, but Doctor Wong explained
									that there was much more that could help.
								</p>
								<em>
									<strong>
										“Magnetic energy controls the flow of “Chi” (positive energy) in the human body.”, he
										said.
										“If we combine Chinese knowledge of magnetic energy with the powerful massage points, we
										can
										create a shoe sole which will have almost miraculous power to relieve pain.”
									</strong>
								</em>
								<p style="margin-top: 25px;">
									Bruce and the doctor worked for months. They made dozens of prototypes and tested every
									version.
									They gave samples to young and old people who suffered pain, and of course Bruce tried them
									himself.
								</p>
								<p>
									What was astonishing was that not only people with pain were helped, but healthy people with
									no
									pain even reported a massive boost in vitality, energy and well being.
								</p>
								<p>
									At long last, the almost magical shoe soles were done. They decided to call them <a
										href="second.html">“MINDINSOLES”</a>,
									because of the transformative nature for the good in people’s
									lives that they created.

									<strong>
										Bruce and Doctor Wong gave out hundreds of samples of <a

										everyone
										they knew.
									</strong>
								</p>
								<p>
									With only word of mouth, people who were suffering and people who loved the new energy they
									felt
									stormed Doctor Wong’s office.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>
										Bruce made another run of prototypes but in a few days they too were gone.
									</strong>
								</p>
								<p>
									He got calls from all over the world. Specialists in Europe has tested <a
										href="second.html">MindInsoles</a> and were
									absolutely astounded at the results. <a href="second.html">MindInsoles</a> were featured in
									dozens of TV
									news shows and
									magazines.
								</p>
								<p>
									When Bruce stopped in his office in New York City, he was shocked to find that half a dozen
									venture capital companies were camped out waiting for him.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>
										Bruce was a canny businessman. “Why were all these companies offering me millions of
										dollars
										for the rights to my secret product? If they think they can make a lot of money
										manufacturing
										<a href="second.html">MindInsoles</a>, why not do it myself??!!”
									</strong>
								</p>
								<div class="content__title">
									<h2>MindInsoles Is Now Available To Everyone!</h2>

								<p>
									Bruce formed a company to sell the original, powerful, perfected <a

									TO
									EVERYONE!
								</p>
								<p>
									He decided to market them direct to the public, at a reasonable price.
								</p>
								<p>
									This was so he could control the quality. The manufacturing process has to be precise. The
									magnets had to be the correct strength and type. The pressure points must be exact. Bruce
									knew
									there might be imitators, but no other company had the real secret.
								</p>
								<p>
									The first run of <a href="second.html">MINDINSOLES</a> EXPLODED. Reorders and new orders

													<p>I suffer from neuropathy and end up with burning feet in a short period of
														time,
														the first time I used MindInsole in my shoes I didn't think about my feet for
														the
														duration of my time out. When I finally took my shoes off I realized that
														there
														was no discomfort . The burning and pain just was not an issue. Thank you so
														much
														for producing a product that works as promised</p>

											some getting used to and you
											can’t wear them all day. There is some discomfort if you’re not used to them or if
											you’re
											wearing them too much, that’s cause they’re meant to be a massage for your feet. If you
											use them as directed, they’ll work perfectly.”</p>
